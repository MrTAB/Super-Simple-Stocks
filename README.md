# Super-Simple-Stocks
Technical Exercise.

The assignment has been implemented in C++ in Visual Studio with the supplied project files.
See "Super Simple Stocks.cpp" for the program entry point of a testing program demonstrating these classes.
The files stdafx.h, stdafx.cpp and targetver.h have been autogenerated and left mostly blank.

Please note that for the formula for P/E Ratio I used the LastDividend as the denominator.
